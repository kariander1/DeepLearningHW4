    "Notes:\n",
    "- The `TrainBatchDataset` class provides a generator function that will use the above function to lazily generate batches of training samples and labels on demand.\n",
    "- This allows us to use a standard `PyTorch` dataloader to wrap our Dataset and provide us with parallel data loading for free!\n",
    "  This means we can run multiple environments with multiple agents in separate background processes to generate data for training and thus prevent the data loading bottleneck which is caused by the fact that we must generate full Episodes to train on in order to calculate the q-values.\n",
    "- We'll set the `DataLoader`'s `batch_size` to `None` because we have already implemented custom batching in our dataset.\n",
    "- You can choose the number of worker processes generating data using the `num_workers` parameter in the hyperparams dict. Set `num_workers=0` to disable parallelization."
